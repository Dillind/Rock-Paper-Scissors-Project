# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Project

# Beginning project.

## This is actually a really difficult project to complete with only theory and videos being your only source of "practice", which is disappointing. I could follow some of the steps included, but overall, this is a really complex task.

## I followed along with a youtube tutorial and actually learned quite a lot. I will now go back over it and attempt to write some of the functions and code by myself.
