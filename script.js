"use strict";

// 1. Understand the problem
// - Create a function called getComputerChoice that will randomly return either 'Rock', 'Paper' or 'Scissors' (RPS).
// - Write a function that plays a single round of RPS. The function should take two parameters - the playerSelection and computerSelection - and then return a string that delcares the winner of the round like so: "You lose! Paper beats Rock!"
// - Make your function's playerSelection paramter case-insensitive (so users can input rock, ROCK, rocK etc.)
// - Write a NEW function called game(). Call the playRound function inside of this one to play a 5 round game that keeps score and reports a winner or loser at the end.

// 2. Plan

// 3. Divide into subproblems
// -

const getComputerChoice = function () {
  return;
};
